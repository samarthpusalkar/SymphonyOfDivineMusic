### **Bhagavad Gita - Chapter 14: Guṇa-trayavibhāgayogaḥ**

**Narrator:**
OM SHRI PARAMATMANE NAMAH. I bow down to the Supreme Consciousness.
And now we start the holy Bhagavad Gita. Thus starts the fourteenth chapter of Bhagavad Gita called Guṇa-trayavibhāgayogaḥ.
Continuing his explanation of the distinction between the physical and the non-physical, Lord Krishna spoke the following words.

**Lord Krishna:**
I shall once again speak to you of this best of knowledge. It is by knowing this that all the great sages attained to the highest of states.

Those who take refuge in this knowledge and realize the true sense of self, they shall not be reborn at the time of creation and nor be destroyed at the time of dissolution.

The entire existence is the womb and it is I who creates life forms in it and therefore it is I who is the sense of existence of all creatures of Arjuna.

O son of Kunti, the forms that take shape in all wombs know that the vastness of creation is the original womb where they were all born and I am the seed that gave them existence and thus am their father.

O mighty armed Arjuna, the materialistic manifestation in turn gives rise to three modes of existence called Satva, Rajas and Tamas. These modes bind the imperishable self within the perishable body.

Among these, Satva-guna being free from impurity is illuminating and full of well-being. O Arjuna, it binds the self by creating attachment for a sense of happiness and knowledge.

O Arjuna, Rajoguna is of the nature of passion. It arises from worldly desires and affections and binds the self through attachment to activity that leads to results.

O Arjuna, Tamoguna which is born out of ignorance is the cause of illusion for the embodied selves. It deludes all living beings through negligence, laziness and sleep.

Satva binds one to material happiness, Rajas conditions the self towards actions and Tamas clouds wisdom and binds one in delusion.

Sometimes, Satva prevails over Rajas and Tamas, O descendant of Bharata. Sometimes, Rajas dominates Satva and Tamas and at other times, Tamas overcomes Satva and Rajas.

When all the portals of the body are illuminated by true knowledge, know it to be a manifestation of the mode of Satva.

When the mode of Rajas predominates, O Arjuna, the symptoms of greed, exertion for worldly gain, restlessness and craving develop.

O Arjuna, gloominess, inertia, negligence and delusion, these are the dominant signs of the mode of Tamas.

When an embodied being passes away in the mode of Satva, one attains to higher states of being which are free of unpleasantness.

When one leaves the body in the mode of Rajas, one is reborn among people driven by work, while those who pass away in the mode of Tamas take birth in a lower species in the series of evolution.

It is said that the fruits of action performed in the mode of Satva are free of entanglement. Actions done in the mode of Rajas result in suffering, while those performed in the mode of Tamas result in ignorance.

From the mode of Satva arises knowledge, from the mode of Rajas arises greed, and from the mode of Tamas arises negligence and delusion.

Those situated in the mode of Satva rise upward, those in the mode of Rajas stay in the middle, and those in the mode of Tamas move downwards in the process of evolution.

When a wise person sees that all activity is in fact inseparable from the modes of existence, and knows that there is a sense of being beyond the modes of materialistic nature, such a person attains to My true sense of self.

By transcending the three modes of materialistic nature associated with the body, one becomes free from birth, death, disease, old age and misery, and attains to immortality.

**Narrator:**
And then, Arjuna asks the following question.

**Arjuna:**
O Lord, what are the characteristics of a person who has gone beyond these three Guṇas? How does such a person act, and how does one attain to such a state?

**Narrator:**
Lord Krishna replied,

**Lord Krishna:**
O Pandava, such a person neither has a liking nor aversion for enlightenment or even delusion.

A person who is not disturbed either by the presence or lack of the influence of the Guṇas, but just acknowledges their existence, is truly established in the Self without wavering.

A person who is well established within the Self, is equanimous in happiness and sorrow, looks at a piece of stone, metal or gold with equanimity, remains in complete balance in pleasantness or unpleasantness, praise or blame.

Such a person remains in complete balance, in honor or dishonor, amidst friends or enemies. A person who is devoid of compulsive desire to act, is said to be beyond the materialistic modes of existence.

A person who serves Me with an unwavering sense of devotion, called Bhaktiyoga, such a person shall rise above the realm of the Guṇas, and is united with the very source of creation.

I am the basis of the source of creation.
Brahman, which has no form, is immortal and imperishable.
I am the basis of eternal dharma and of unending divine bliss.

**Narrator:**
And thus ends the fourteenth chapter by the name of Guṇatrayavibhāgayoga. This is taken from Śrīmad Bhagavad Gītā, a conversation between Lord Krishna and Arjuna on the science of Yoga, which is the knowledge of ultimate reality called as Brahma-vidyā. OM SHRI PARAMATMANE NAMAH.
