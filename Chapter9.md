### **Bhagavad Gita - Chapter 9: The King of Knowledge, The King of Secrets**

**Narrator:**
I bow down to the Supreme Consciousness. And now we start the holy Bhagavad Gita. Thus starts the ninth chapter of Bhagavad Gita, which describes the King of Knowledge, the King of Secrets.

**Lord Krishna:**
After having described the true nature of oneself, which is the eternal and unchanging unity of existence, Lord Krishna continued to speak thus: O Arjuna, I shall now speak to you about the most well-preserved of secrets. I shall give you the knowledge, along with the corresponding techniques, following which you shall be liberated from that which is inauspicious.

This is the highest, most sacred, and well-preserved of all knowledge. This knowledge sustains your well-being, can be directly perceived, and is easy to pursue. O Arjuna, those who lack focus and dedication in this path do not realize My true abode and continue to be bound by the cycles of life and death.

It is that inexplicable `I` who pervades all of this creation. It is an `I` that all creatures are established in, but this `I` is not limited to any one of them. And neither do these creatures reside in the true sense of Me. O Arjuna, perceive the true extent of this unity and the realm of `I`. The nature of `myself` sustains and nourishes the creatures, but is not limited within them.

As air that occupies some space pervades all of that space all the time and is established in it, similarly, all creatures are established and sustained by the sense of `I`. O son of Kunti, all of these creatures attain to the nature of being identified with `myself`. At the end of creation, I shall let go of them, and at the beginning of creation, they shall attain to Me again. `I` shall attain to the nature of `myself` and get to be identified by all of creation, again and again, as if being driven by the compulsive force of nature.

O Arjuna, none of these actions bind Me. I remain above and beyond these actions, and am disentangled from them. Under My influence, nature springs forth all of creation. It is due to `I`, O son of Kunti, that all of this creation undergoes change.

Those who are deluded do not realize `I`, who has taken up a personified form. They do not know of the true realm of `I`. They do not realize that I am of the beyond. They are deluded by the urges of desire. They are deluded by compulsive action born out of it. Their minds are skewed by this deluded knowledge of the `self`. They then take refuge in this deluded nature of `self`, which is of the asuras and of the rakshasas.

Those who have an evolved sense of `self`, O Arjuna, take refuge in the divine sense of self. They realize the prime source of all creation and meditate upon Me with unwavering focus. They then continuously praise the glory of My true nature with a steadfast will. They surrender to Me with devotion and shall be constantly united in Me.

Others are united in Me through the sacrifice of knowledge. Through one method or the other, the path to this cosmic `I` is manifold. It is `I` who is the rules of the ritual, and `I` am the ritual itself. `I` am the nourishment offered in the ritual, and `I` am that which is an extract of it. `I` am the chant of the ritual, and `I` am the fuel that powers it. `I` am the fire of the ritual, and `I` am that which is offered into it.

Of this creation, `I` am the father, the mother, the sustainer, and the protector. `I` am that sacred sound, Om, that needs to be realized. `I` am the embodiment of the three Vedas. `I` am the path, the bearer, the lord, and the witness. `I` am the one who resides, the refuge, and the friend. `I` am the origin, end, and abode of all creation. `I` am the unchanging seed, and the storehouse both.

It is `I` who excites, and `I` who showers. It is `I` who holds on, and `I` who lets go. `I` am immortality, and `I` am death. `I` am that which exists, and which doesn't.

Those who are knowledgeable in the three-fold practices of materialistic sacrifice, who are rid of their sinful actions, who relish the results of their action, perform these sacrifices, and wish for celestial abodes. They then begat merit and attain to the abode of Indra, the lord of all gods. Here they relish the celestial pleasures that are enjoyed by gods.

After relishing the pleasures of celestial abodes, once they are devoid of the results of their merit, they fall back into the realm of the mortals. Thus, people who follow the three-fold actions of existence fall into these repeated cycles of desire and temporary fulfillment. But those who always strive to realize Me, with unfaltering focus, `I` myself shall conduct both survival and liberation for such people.

O son of Kunti, even those devotees who faithfully worship other deities with steadfast focus, they are also in fact trying to attain to Me, but without the right approach. `I` am the one who performs all sacrifices, and it is `I` who relishes the results obtained from them. But those who do not know My true nature, as that which is inseparable from everything else, miss the whole point.

Those who worship deities attain to the respective deities of worship, and those who worship their ancestors attain to them. Those who strive for material creation attain to it, and those who strive to realize My true nature, realize `myself`.

When one offers something to Me with devotion, be it a leaf, flower, fruit, or a drink, `I` shall consume that object of devoted offering into My own `Self`. Whatever you do, whatever you eat, whatever you put to use and whatever you give away, whatever austerities you perform, O son of Kunti, do them as an offering to Me. And by doing so, you shall be free from the entanglements of the pleasant or unpleasant results of action, and thus liberated, you shall attain to Me through this process of renunciation yoga.

I am equally established in all living beings. `I` have neither enmity nor partiality to anyone. But those who worship Me through devotion, they are established in Me, and `I` in them. Even if someone with bad compulsive tendencies pursues Me with soul-focus, such a person is considered to be on the right path and is considered virtuous. Such a person shall fall onto the path of righteousness in no time and attain to long-lasting peace.

O son of Kunti, know that someone who is devoted to Me is never lost. Irrespective of one's birth, one's tendencies, one's gender, nature, or occupation, those who take refuge in Me shall attain to this ultimate state of existence. What then to speak of those who realize the nature of the Absolute Truth, those who perform meritorious deeds, those who are devoted, and those who are staunch practitioners.

Therefore, having attained to this impermanent world of fleeting pleasures, now strive towards realizing Me. Always think of Me. Be devoted to Me. Worship Me. And strive to reach Me. Having dedicated your sense of `self` to realizing My true nature, you shall attain to Me.

**Narrator:**
And thus ends the ninth chapter by the name of the King of Knowledge, the King of Secrets. This is taken from the holy Bhagavad Gita, a conversation between Lord Krishna and Arjuna on the science of yoga which is the knowledge of ultimate reality called as the knowledge of Brahman. I bow down to the Supreme Consciousness.
