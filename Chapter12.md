### **Bhagavad Gita - Chapter 12: Bhakti-Yoga**

**Narrator:**
I bow down to the Supreme Consciousness, and now we start the holy Bhagavad Gita. Thus starts the twelfth chapter of Bhagavad Gita, called as Bhakti-Yoga. After having seen the fierce form of Lord Krishna as the ultimate unified form of existence, and having heard that devotion is the only means to realize and become one with that, Arjuna had more questions and spoke to Krishna thus.

**Arjuna:**
O Krishna, between those who are steadfastly devoted to your personified form, and those who worship the formless unity, who are the ones who are better yogis?

**Lord Krishna:**
Those who fix their minds on me, and are always devoted to me with unwavering focus, I consider them to be the best of yogis.

But those who worship the formless aspect of the absolute truth, the imperishable, the indefinable, the unmanifest, the all-pervading, the unthinkable, the unchanging, eternal and fixed; by restraining their senses and being even-minded everywhere, such people, engaged in the welfare of all beings, they too shall attain to me.

For those whose minds are attached to the unmanifest, the path towards realization is more troublesome. Worship of the unmanifest is extremely difficult for embodied beings.

But those who dedicate all their actions to me, regarding me as the supreme goal, worshipping me and meditating upon me with exclusive devotion, O Partha, I swiftly deliver them from the ocean of birth and death, since their minds have entered me.

Fix your mind upon me alone, and surrender your intellect to me. Thereupon you will always live in me. Of this there is no doubt.

If you are unable to fix your mind steadily upon me, then practice remembering me with devotion while constantly restraining the mind from worldly affairs.

If you cannot practice remembering me with devotion, then just try to work for me. Thus, performing devoted service to me, you shall find attainment.

If you are unable to work for me with devotion, then try to renounce the fruits of your actions and be situated in the Self.

True knowledge of the Self leads to a greater well-being than following mere practices. Sustained meditation upon the Self leads to a greater well-being than knowledge. Disentanglement from the fruits of action leads to an even better state of well-being, and even better than that is staying in a continuous ambience of inner peace.

Such a devotee is very dear to me, who is free from malice towards all living beings, who is friendly and compassionate. Such a person is free from attachment to possessions and egocentrism. Such a person is equanimous in happiness and in distress, and is ever forgiving.

Someone who is steadily united with me in devotion, self-controlled, firm in conviction, and dedicated to me in mind and intellect, is very dear to me.

A person who is not a source of unpleasantness to anyone, and who in turn is not agitated by anyone, who is equanimous in pleasure and pain, and free from fear and anxiety, such a devotee of mine is very dear to me.

A person who is indifferent to worldly gain, externally and internally pure, skillful, devoid of worries, and free from selfishness in all undertakings, such a devotee of mine is very dear to me.

A person who neither rejoices in mundane pleasures, nor despairs in worldly sorrows, who neither laments for any loss, nor hankers for any gain, who renounces both good and evil deeds, such a person who is full of devotion, is very dear to me.

A person who is equanimous to friend and foe, equi-poised in honor and dishonor, cold and heat, joy and sorrow, and is free from all worldly entanglement. A person who takes praise and reproach alike, who is given to silent contemplation, content with what comes one's way, who is not bound by any identities, whose intellect is firmly fixed in me, and who is full of devotion to me, such a person is very dear to me.

Those who continuously meditate upon this nectar like Dharma, as it is mentioned here, with devoted focus towards me, such devotees are dearest to me.

**Narrator:**
And thus ends the twelfth chapter by the name of Bhaktiyogaha. This is taken from Shrimad Bhagavad Gita, a conversation between Lord Krishna and Arjuna on the science of yoga, which is the knowledge of ultimate reality, called as Brahmavidya. Om Shri Paramatmane Namaha. Om Shri Paramatmane Namaha.
