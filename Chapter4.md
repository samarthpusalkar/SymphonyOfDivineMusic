### **Bhagavad Gita - Chapter 4: The Yoga of Knowledge and the Renunciation of Action**

**Narrator:**
OM SHRI PARAMATMANE NAMAH. I bow down to the Supreme Consciousness.
And now we start the holy Bhagavad Gita.

**Narrator:**
Continuing to clarify Arjuna's confused questions, Lord Krishna speaks thus.

**Lord Krishna:**
Oh Arjuna, `I` spoke of this eternal science of Yoga to the Sun Deity, Vivasvan.
He then passed it on to Manu, who in turn instructed it to Ikshavaku.
Oh Arjuna, the greatest of sages does receive this science of Yoga in a continuous tradition.
But with a long passage of time, this knowledge slowly got lost.
Today I have spoken to you of this very same science of Yoga, which is of great antiquity.
I only imparted this secret treasure to you, since you are devoted to me, and I consider you a dear friend.

**Arjuna:**
Oh Krishna, the birth of Sun Deity is beyond your lifetime. How then do I understand that you spoke of this to him?

**Lord Krishna:**
Both you and I have had many lifetimes, Oh Arjuna. You have forgotten them while I remember them all.

Even though `I` am without birth or decay, even though `I` have absolute control over all elements of creation, `I` exist as a part of this creation through the illusion of my own self.

As and when there is a disturbance to Dharma, that which sustains balance, and there is an uprising of Adharma, imbalance that leads to unsustainability, Oh Arjuna, `I` then create my own self in this creation.

In order to protect that which leads to balance, and to destroy that which leads to imbalance, in order to establish Dharma, the law that sustains, `I` manifest myself again and again.

Those who understand the divine nature of my birth and my activity, Oh Arjuna, upon leaving the body, they break the cycles of life and death and attain to me.

By letting go of their entanglement, fear and anger, many have taken refuge in me. They have thus become one with me through their intensity of knowledge.

Through whichever means people reach out to me, `I` reach back to them through the same means. Everyone follows my path in so many different ways, Oh Arjuna.

Those who desire results to their actions, worship deities in this world. Here, humans attain to quick results only through their Karma or activity.

Based on one's Gunas, qualities, and Karmas, actions, `I` have created a four-fold spectrum. Although I am the creator of this spectrum, know that `I` am without activity and without change.

Activities do not taint me, nor do `I` desire the fruits of action. One who knows me thus, is never entangled in activity.

Even in the past, seekers of liberation performed their activity with this realization. Therefore, follow in their footsteps and perform activity in such a way.

Even the wise are confused by the distinction between detached activity and just laziness. I shall now explain the nature of true activity upon knowing which you shall be free from the inauspicious.

You must understand the nature of recommended activity, the nature of wrong-approached activity, and the nature of giving up activity. This knowledge of activity is deep and subtle.

Those who see action in inaction and inaction in action are truly wise amongst humans. They are involved in performing all kinds of activity without being entangled by them.

Those who start all activity without fixating upon the end result, with their activity purified in the fire of knowledge, such people are known as the truly wise ones.

Such people, having given up entanglement to the fruits of their action, are always satisfied and not dependent on external things. Despite engaging in activities, they do not do anything at all.

The one who is rid of desire, with one's mind under the control of the self, who has no sense of possession over anything, such a person will use one's physical body just as a tool towards action, and doesn't get entangled.

Content with whatever gain comes one's way, and free from envy, such people are beyond the dualities of life. Being equanimous in success and failure, they are not bound by their actions, even while performing all kinds of activities.

It is the all-pervading consciousness, which is the consumed. It is the means of consumption, it is the cause of consumption, and it is that which consumes. The consciousness is the one which is able to develop into its own self, through activity which is performed with an equanimous mind established in consciousness.

Some yogis perform Yajna while others perform a Yajna which is beyond that by offering their own activity into the fire of all-pervading consciousness.

They offer their hearing and other senses of perception into the fire of self-control, while others offer sound and other objects of the senses into the fire of the sense perception.

While yet others who are enlightened by knowledge offer the functions of all their senses and their life energy into the fire of a constantly realized self.

Of all the Yajnas mentioned before, the Yajna of self-austerity is beyond the Yajna of material offerings. Even beyond that is the Yajna of Yoga which aims towards realizing the true self. And even beyond that is the Yajna of knowledge through the study of one's own self with a steadfast focus.

In this process of Yajna, some offer the outgoing breath into the incoming breath, while some offer the incoming breath into the outgoing breath. They rigorously practice Pranayama by absolute control over the incoming and outgoing breaths, which gives one access to the very life energies within.

Yet others perform another kind of Yajna where they curtail their intake and consumption and offer their breath into their very own life energy. All of the above-mentioned who have the knowledge of Yajna are gradually cleansed of their faults.

The ones who consume the nectar-like outcome of such Yajnas, attain to the eternal consciousness. For the ones who do not know any kind of Yajna, there is nothing to attain in this world, O Arjuna. Then where does the question of attaining that which is beyond arise?

And thus, various kinds of Yajna have been expounded upon by the Creator. All of them are born out of activity or Karma. Know these Yajnas and attain to liberation.

O Arjuna, the Yajna of knowledge will lead you to a better state of well-being than the Yajna of material offerings. All entanglement with activity will thus stop with true knowledge.

Those who are realized may bestow this true knowledge to you. Know that knowledge by taking refuge in them, by clarifying your doubts with them, and by service to them.

Following this path and having achieved this knowledge, O Arjuna, you will no longer fall back into delusion. In the light of that knowledge, you will see the unity in all beings as `I` see it within `me`.

Even if you have committed the worst of sins, this boat of true knowledge will take you across the endless ocean of life and death.

As a kindled fire reduces wood to ashes, O Arjuna, the fire of knowledge burns down all activity.

In this world, there is nothing as pure as true knowledge. One who is prepared for Yoga knows this experientially within one's own self. The one with a steady focus attains to knowledge. The one who is in control over one's own senses attains to knowledge that is further beyond. Once that is attained, one is quickly established in unwavering awareness. Once that is attained, one is quickly established in unwavering peace within.

The one who has neither knowledge nor focus, the one who is in constant dilemma, is destroyed. For such a person, the options here and beyond are both lost. There is no pleasantness anywhere for someone who is in constant doubt.

O Arjuna, actions do not bind such people whose acts are established in Yoga, whose dilemmas have been destroyed by knowledge, and those who are established within their true self.

O descendant of Bharata, the doubt in your heart is born out of ignorance. Destroy it with the sword of knowledge of your true self. Establish yourself in `Yoga` and arise.

**Narrator:**
And thus ends the fourth chapter by the name of Jnana Karma Sannyasa Yoga. This is taken from Srimad Bhagavad Gita, a conversation between Lord Krishna and Arjuna on the science of Yoga, which is the knowledge of ultimate reality called as Brahma Vidya. OM SHRI PARAMATMANE NAMAH.
