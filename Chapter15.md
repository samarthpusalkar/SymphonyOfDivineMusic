### **Bhagavad Gita - Chapter 15: The Yoga of the Supreme Person**

**Narrator:**
I bow down to the Supreme Consciousness, and now we start the holy Bhagavad Gita. Thus starts the 15th chapter of Bhagavad Gita, called Purushottama Yoga.
After having explained the three modes of materialistic existence and their ever-transforming qualities, Lord Krishna goes on to describe that which is eternal. He says:

**Lord Krishna:**
This unchanging eternal aspect of existence is said to be like an Asvattha tree with its roots hanging down from above, which enter the earth and become stems again. The leaves of this tree are the Vedas. The one who realizes this is said to have the wealth of true knowledge.

Continuing this analogy, the branches that grow out of this eternal tree are like the senses that grow from the three modes of materialistic nature. These intertwining branches are like the senses which bind the self into a human form through attachment to action.

The true form of this eternal divinity, its origin or end, is not readily perceivable, just as one cannot perceive the true origin or end of a widely spread Asvattha tree. This analogy of an Asvattha tree has to be spliced open by the strong weapon of impartial perception. And from there, one should approach the state of being after attaining which there is no falling back. It is that highest state of being that I praise, from which the nature of all activity sprang forth.

Those who are free from vanity and delusion, who have overcome the evil of entanglement, who dwell constantly in the realm of spirituality, who are freed from the pull of desires and are beyond the dualities of pleasure and pain, such people who are free of delusion attain to that eternal abode. Neither the sun, nor the moon, nor fire can illuminate that supreme abode as it is beyond the realm of the physical. Having gone there, one does not get entangled to this material world again.

It is the aspects of this eternal I that take form as all living creatures in existence. It is this I that attracts the six senses, including the mind, which bind it to the materialistic plane. The body that this sense of I takes on and leaves from, it carries the corresponding materialistic aspects along, just as the air carries fragrance.

This sense of I consumes the objects of the senses, using the sense perceptions of the ears, eyes, skin, tongue and nose, which are all sustained by the mind. The ignorant do not perceive this I as it resides in the body and as it enjoys the sense objects, nor do they perceive it when it departs, but those who possess the eyes of knowledge perceive it. Even the practitioners of yoga see this sense of self situated within the body, but even upon striving, those who have not set their minds upon the self do not perceive it.

The radiance of the sun that illuminates the entire world, the brilliance of the moon and of the fire, know that brilliance to be the sense of self. Permeating the entire earth, I sustain all living beings with My ojas. By being Soma, the embodiment of essence, I nourish all plants with the juice of life. It is I who takes on the form of the all-pervading fire of living beings, and by being united with the process of inhalation and exhalation, I digest and assimilate the four kinds of food.

I am seated in the hearts of all living beings, and from I comes memory, knowledge as well as forgetfulness. It is I which is to be realized through all the Vedas. I am the creator of Vedanta and the knower of the Vedas.

There are two kinds of beings in creation: the kshara, perishable, and the akshara, imperishable. The perishable are all beings of the material realm, and the imperishable are the ones situated in the true sense of self. Apart from these two, there is another highest state of being which is generally referred to as the supreme divinity. It is this powerful state of being which pervades all the three worlds and sustains all of creation.

Since I am beyond that which is perishable and that which is imperishable, I am praised as the supreme state of being, both in the scriptures and in the world. The one who is not deluded and knows Me thus as the supreme state of being, such a person of complete knowledge, worships Me in all possible ways, O descendant of Bharata. This well-preserved shastra that I have imparted to you, O sinless one, realize this in order to be knowledgeable on what needs to be done and what does not, O descendant of Bharata.

**Narrator:**
And thus ends the fifteenth chapter by the name of Purushottama Yoga. This is taken from Shrimad Bhagavad Gita, a conversation between Lord Krishna and Arjuna on the science of yoga which is the knowledge of ultimate reality called as Brahma Vidya.
