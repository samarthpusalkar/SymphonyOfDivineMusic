### **Bhagavad Gita - Chapter 8: The Yoga of Imperishable Brahman**

**Narrator:**
I bow down to the Supreme Consciousness.
And now we start the holy Bhagavad Gita.
Arjuna now has a series of questions which he expresses thus:

**Arjuna:**
O Achyuta, what is that which is called as Brahman? What is Adhyatma? What is Karma? What is called as Adhibhutam? And what is called as Adhidaivam?
O Madhusudana, what is Adhiyagnya? And who and where is it in the body? How does one who is on the path of self-realization realize You at the time of leaving the body?

**Lord Krishna:**
That which is unchanging and eternal is called as Brahman. Knowing the true nature of the self is called as Adhyatma. That which is born out of the nature of that which has been created is known by the name Karma.

The constantly changing nature of this creation is called as Adhibhutam. That aspect of creation that moves one forward, known as Purusha, is called as Adhidaivatam.

O Arjuna, Adhiyagnya is I and myself, which is here and now within this body.

O Arjuna, there is absolutely no doubt that someone who remembers the true Me as one who leaves the body at the end of one's time, attains to Myself.

O son of Kunti, whichever state of being one remembers as one leaves this mortal body, one continues to stay in that same state of remembrance, and that becomes one's nature.

And so, O Arjuna, always remember the true Me even as you participate in this fight. Without a doubt, someone who has dedicated one's mind in Myself shall attain to Me.

O Partha, with an unwavering awareness that is regularly united with the practice of yoga, one shall certainly attain to that ultimate state of self-realization.

By meditating on the source of all intelligence, who is most ancient, all-controlling, who is more minute than the minutest; by meditating on the supreme nature of the self, which sustains everything, whose form is beyond the scope of thought; by going beyond one's nature of Tamas, and by meditating on that which shines like the sun.

One who at the time of death, with unmoving mind that is immersed in devotion, by the strength gained through the practice of yoga, fixes the Prana between one's eyebrows, such a person attains to that eternal and ultimate state of being called Purusha.

O Arjuna, I shall now briefly talk to you about that eternal, unchanging state of being, which is described by enlightened beings. That state in which those who are devoid of entanglements establish themselves. That state in pursuit of which people take up the path of Brahmacharya.

After controlling all the gateways into one's self, by fixing one's Manas into one's Hrudaya, and by bringing one's Prana in between the eyebrows, one who establishes oneself in yoga – the one who in such a state then continuously remembers Me through repeated usage of the cosmic sound Pranava or Omkara – the one who departs from this mortal body, attains to this ultimate state.

O Partha, the one who always remembers Me constantly, without any other thought in the mind, to such an immersed Yogi, I am very easily attainable.

Having attained to the true sense of Me, these great beings are no more subject to rebirth in this world which is transient and full of misery. They have attained to the highest of attainments.

In all the worlds of this material creation, up to the highest abode of Brahma, you will be subject to rebirth, O Arjuna. But upon attaining to the abode of Me, O son of Kunti, there is no further rebirth.

Those who have attained to the realm of Brahman experience 1000 Yugas as a span of a day and the next 1000 Yugas as a night.

At the advent of Brahma's day, everything manifests from the unmanifest. At nightfall, everything dissolves back into the unmanifest.

Clusters of such creation get created and dissolved over and over again. At the break of dawn, they are manifest and with nightfall, they get dissolved again as if beyond their control.

And beyond these cycles of creation and dissolution exists that state of being, which is eternal and ultimate. This ultimate state of being exists in all that is created but doesn't get destroyed during dissolution. This state, which is indescribable and unchanging, is called the ultimate state of existence. By attaining to this state, one is no longer bound by the cycles of creation. That is the true abode of Me.

O Partha, that ultimate state of existence, called Purusha, which pervades all of creation, can only be attained through unparalleled devotion.

O best of Bharatas, I shall now speak to you of the signs that indicate whether one has crossed beyond the cycles of birth and death, or if one is still bound to them.

Those who know the ultimate Brahman and who depart from this world during the six months of the sun's northern run, the bright fortnight of the moon, and the bright part of the day, realize the true nature of Brahman and become a part of it.

Those who pass away during the six months of the sun's southern run, the time of smoke, and the night, attain the celestial abodes. After enjoying celestial pleasures, they return to the cycles of birth and death.

These two bright and dark paths always exist in this world. The way of light leads to liberation, and the way of darkness leads to rebirth. O Partha, a true Yogi does not get deluded even by knowing the secret of existence. Therefore, O Arjuna, strive to be a Yogi.

All great results one can attain through the rituals of Vedas, Yajñas, austerities and donations. A Yogi gains much more than all of them combined by just realizing this one truth of existence, and then attains to the supreme abode of the Self.

**Narrator:**
And thus ends the eighth chapter by the name of Akshara Brahma Yoga. This is taken from Srimad Bhagavad Gita, a conversation between Lord Krishna and Arjuna on the science of yoga, which is the knowledge of ultimate reality called as Brahma Vidya.
