### **Bhagavad Gita - Chapter 7: The Yoga of Knowledge and Realization (English Only)**

**Narrator:**
I bow down to the Supreme Consciousness. And now we start the holy Bhagavad Gita. Thus starts the seventh chapter of Bhagavad Gita, which describes Gnana-vijnana-yoga, where Lord Krishna gives Arjuna the knowledge and the methodology through which one can attain to the true knowledge of the Self.

**Lord Krishna:**
O Arjuna, now hear the ways in which those whose minds are invested in Me, who take refuge in Me, and strive towards yoga, attain to Me, surely and completely.

I shall now speak to you fully about this knowledge and methodology, knowing which nothing else remains to be known in this world.

Among thousands of human beings, hardly one person strives for this kind of attainment, and among those who strive towards it, hardly one person gets to realize Me as the eternal unity.

Earth, Water, Fire, Air, Space, Mind, Intellect, and the sense of Selfâ€”these are eight-fold manifestations of My materialistic nature. O mighty-armed Arjuna, there is another manifestation of Me, the nature of which is beyond the ones I mentioned before. This is the manifestation that resides in all of creation and sustains it.

Know that all living beings are born out of the coming together of these two natures of Mine. I am the source of existence and the destination of dissolution for all of creation. There is nothing that is beyond Myself, O Arjuna. Everything is held through Me, as a group of beads are strung on a thread.

I am the life essence in water, O son of Kunti. I am the radiance of the sun and the moon. I am the cosmic sound, Pranava, in all of the Vedas, and I am the sound in space. I am the very existence among humans. I am the nourishing fragrance of the earth and the brilliance of the fire. I am the life force in all human beings and the generated glow of the ascetics.

O Arjuna, know that I am the eternal seed of all beings. I am the intellect of the intelligent and the splendor of the glorious. O best of Bharatas, I am the strength of the strong which is devoid of entanglements of lust. I am the sense of desire that is not against the sustenance of life.

All of those states of existence that belong to Sattva, Rajas, and Tamas, know that they are born out of Me. I am not within them.

Deluded by the three modes of Maya, the people in this world are unable to know Me as the Self that is imperishable and eternal. This divine illusion of Myself that is bound in the three modes of nature is hard to overcome. Those who take refuge in the true essence of Me alone are able to overcome this delusion.

People of lower tendencies who are ignorant of the true nature of Myself do not strive towards knowing Me. They resort to baser tendencies since their knowledge is overcome by delusion.

People of higher tendencies who strive towards realizing Me fall into four categories, O Arjuna: those who are distressed, those who are curious, those who seek to achieve something, and those who seek knowledge. Among these, those who seek Me for the sake of true knowledge with constant devotion are truly special. They value Me very dearly, and I value them very dearly.

Indeed, people of all four categories are sincere in their efforts, but those who seek Me through knowledge I consider to be the very embodiment of the Self. Such people are truly established in Myself and attain to the highest of states.

After continued spiritual practices in many cycles of birth and death, one who seeks knowledge attains to Me. Such a person who realizes that it is I, Vasudeva, who is everything that exists, is really rare to find.

Others whose knowledge is taken to various kinds of desires, take to the worship of various kinds of deities respectively. Based on their individual natures, they perform practices that achieve their desires. Whoever wishes to approach and worship whichever form or deity, I respond with the same focus and steadfastness back unto themselves. Such worship of those deities performed by those people with focus and steadfastness yields results accordingly. Know that it is from I alone that these results have originated.

Such results obtained by worshipping deities in this world come with an end date. Those who are of a lower understanding resort to the worship of such deities, but those who are interested in knowing the Self resort to Me.

Those without the right understanding think that I am of this form. The truth is that I am indescribable. They do not know of the true nature of Myself which is ultimate and is of the beyond. I am not clearly evident to everyone because of the veil of illusion around the Self. Those who are deluded cannot realize the nature of My true Self which is unchanging and eternal.

I know of that which has existed, that which exists, and that which is going to exist, O Arjuna, but no one realizes the true nature of Me. O destroyer of enemies, all creatures that are born are deluded by the feelings of liking and aversion which are caused due to the illusion of the dualities of existence. But those people whose faults have been destroyed by engaging in right practices become free from the illusion of such dualities. Such people are established firmly in Myself.

Those who strive for liberation from the cycles of birth and death by taking refuge in Me, they realize that divine, all-pervading nature and activity of pure consciousness. Those who know Me as the principal aspect of materialistic creation and the principal aspect of all divinity, such people who are of an evolved consciousness realize the true nature of the Self as they leave the body.

**Narrator:**
And thus ends the seventh chapter by the name of Jnana Vijnana Yoga. This is taken from Srimad Bhagavad Gita, a conversation between Lord Krishna and Arjuna on the science of yoga, which is the knowledge of ultimate reality called as Brahma Vidya.
