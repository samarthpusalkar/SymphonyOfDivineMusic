### **Bhagavad Gita - Chapter 17: The Yoga of the Division of Faith**

**Narrator:**
I bow down to the Supreme Consciousness. And now we start the holy Bhagavad Gita. Thus starts the seventeenth chapter of Bhagavad Gita, named ShraddhAtrAya-vibhAga-yogaH. After listening to Lord Krishna's descriptions of both the divine and demonic qualities of existence, Arjuna asked him the following question:

**Arjuna:**
O Krishna, those who do not follow the guidelines of the shastras, but still worship with a steadfast focus, what about their austerity? Is it of the mode of satva, rajas or tamas?

**Lord Krishna:**
O Arjuna, the steadfast focus of all embodied beings, born out of their own nature, is of three kinds. Listen now as I describe how they are classified into the modes of satva, rajas and tamas.

The steadfast focus of all humans takes form after the satva within them. One's own self is full of this focus. In fact, one can be verily identified by what one is focused upon.

Those in the mode of satva worship the celestial deities; those in the mode of rajas worship the yakshas and the rakshasas; and those in the mode of tamas worship the disembodied cells and the bhutas.

Those who perform stern austerities, which are not prescribed by the scriptures, are driven by hypocrisy and egotism, and are impelled by the force of desire and attachment. They torment not only the elements of their body, but also I, who dwells within them, as a supreme sense of self. Know that these senseless people are of a demonic resolve.

Even the food people prefer is according to their dispositions. The same is true for the yajna, austerity and charity they are inclined towards. Now listen as to how they are classified.

People in the mode of satva prefer foods that promote life span, increase vigor, strength, health, happiness and satisfaction. Such foods are juicy, succulent, nourishing and natural. These foods are considered to be the most nutritious foods in the world. Such foods are juicy, succulent, nourishing and naturally tasteful.

Foods that are too bitter, too sour, salty, very hot, pungent, dry and sharp in taste are dear to people in the mode of rajas. Such foods produce pain, grief and disease.

Foods that are overcooked, stale, putrid, polluted and impure are dear to people in the mode of tamas.

Yajna that is performed according to the scriptural prescription, without expectation of rewards, with the firm conviction of the mind that it is a matter of duty, is of the nature of satva.

O best of the Bharatas, know that yajna, which is performed for material benefit or with hypocritical aim, is in the mode of rajas.

Yajna devoid of focus and contrary to the prescription of the scriptures, in which no food is offered, no mantras are chanted and no charity is made, is considered to be in the mode of tamas.

Worship of the deities, of enlightened beings, of spiritual masters and of the wise, cleanliness, simplicity, brahmacharya and non-violence are all considered as the austerity of the body.

Words that do not cause distress are truthful, loving and beneficial, as well as the regular study of the self. These are considered as the austerity of speech.

Serenity of the mind, gentleness, silence, self-control and purity of being, all these are considered as the austerity of the mind.

The austerity that is drenched with the three kinds of steadfast focus of people who are not entangled to the fruits of their action, is considered to be in the mode of satva.

Austerity that is performed with ostentation for the sake of gaining honor, respect and adoration, is in the mode of rajas. Its benefits are unstable and transitory.

Austerity that is performed by those with deluded notions, and which involves torturing the self or harming others, is described to be in the mode of tamas.

Charity that is given simply because it is the needed thing to do, without the consideration of anything in return, at the proper time and in the proper place, is stated to be in the mode of satva.

But charity given in return of a favor, with reluctance, with the hope of a return, or in expectation of a reward, is said to be in the mode of rajas.

And that charity, which is given at the wrong place and wrong time, to unworthy people, without proper respect or with contempt, is held to be in the nature of tamas.

The three words, Om Tat Sat, are the identification of the all-pervading Brahman. From these three words came forth the enlightened ones, the Vedas and the Yajnas.

Therefore, when performing acts of Yajna, offering charity, or undertaking penance, expounders of the Vedas always begin by uttering Om, according to the prescriptions of the Vedas.

People who do not desire fruits of their actions, but seek to be free from the material entanglements, utter the word Tat, along with acts of austerity, Yajna and charity.

The word Sat means eternal existence and sattva. O Partha, it is also used to describe an auspicious action.

Being established in the performance of Yajna, penance and charity is also described by the word Sat, and thus any activity for such purposes is named Sat.

O Partha, whichever acts of Yajna or penance, done without steadfast focus, are termed as Asat; they are useless both in this world and the next.

**Narrator:**
And thus ends the seventeenth chapter by the name of ShraddhAtrAya VibhAga-YogaH. This is taken from Shreemad Bhagavad Gita, the conversation between Lord Krishna and Arjuna on the science of Yoga, which is the knowledge of ultimate reality called as Brahma Vidya. Om Shri Paramatmane Namah.
