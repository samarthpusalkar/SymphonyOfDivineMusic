### **Bhagavad Gita - Chapter 10: The Yoga of Divine Glories**

**Narrator:**
I bow down to the Supreme Consciousness, and now we start the holy Bhagavad Gita. Thus starts the 10th chapter of Bhagavad Gita, which describes Vibhuti Yoga.

**Lord Krishna:**
O mighty armed Arjuna, listen again as I speak of this highest truth. I speak to you of this, since you are very dear to me, and I have your best interests at heart.

Neither the celestial Suras nor the great sages know of the origin of `I`. `I` am the source from which all of the Gods and great sages come forth. The one who knows that `I` am eternal, without a beginning or end, and that `I` is the one who rules over all of creation, such a person, devoid of illusion, is free of all evils.

Intellect, knowledge, clarity of thought, capabilities, truthfulness, self-control, peacefulness, pleasantness, unpleasantness, life, death, fear and courage, non-violence, equanimity, contentment, austerity, charity, fame and infamy—it is due to `I` that all these different qualities come into existence.

The seven great sages of the past and the four Manus were all established in me and acted out of this identity. All of this creation and the creatures belonged to them. That person who knows this state of existence and the unity of `I` as the truth, such a person strives towards it with unwavering focus and undoubtedly gets united with it.

`I` am the origin of all creation. It is from `I` that everything springs forth. Those who realize this, who are of an equanimous interiority, try to attain me. Their minds are focused on me. Their life energies are drawn towards me. They teach each other of me and always find contentment and bliss in the talk of me.

To such people who are consciously united in this sense of `I` with loving devotion, `I` shall grant them the knowledge through which they shall attain to the true nature of `myself`. And with this brilliant light of knowledge, `I` shall destroy their tamas which is born so they may resonate with the same sense of `self` that I am established in.

**Arjuna:**
O Krishna, the purest being, the highest abode, the one who is all-pervading, eternal, brilliant, all-encompassing, and the first of the celestial deities, these are the names given to you by all sages. Everybody, including Devarshi Narada, Asita, Devala, Vyasa and you yourself have told me so.

O Keshava, even if I agree with whatever you have spoken to me so far, O brilliant one, neither the Devas nor the Dhanavas know the true expression of you. O Lord of Devas, O Lord of creation, O Lord of all creatures who resides in all of creation, it is you alone who truly knows the nature of your own divine `Self`.

You alone are capable of describing to me your divine sense of existence completely, that state of being through which you are established in all of creation. O Lord, how do I know of you as the yogi that you are? In which aspects of existence can I think of you and grasp you with my mind?

O Janardana, tell me again of the glory of your state of being in complete detail. I am still not content after hearing your nectar-like words.

**Lord Krishna:**
O best of the Kurus, so be it! I shall speak to you of the prominent aspects of this divine state of existence, since there is no end to it if I go into it in detail.

What is the need for all this detailed knowledge, O Arjuna? Simply know that by one fraction of my divine state of existence, `I` pervade and support this entire creation.
