### **Bhagavad Gita - Chapter 18: The Yoga of Liberation and Renunciation**

**Narrator:**
OM SHRI PARAMATMANE NAMAH. I bow down to the Supreme Consciousness.
And now we start the Holy Bhagavad Gita. Thus starts the 18th chapter of Bhagavad Gita called Mokshasanyasayogah. After having heard of various kinds of techniques to attain to the state of yoga, Arjuna asked Lord Krishna the following questions.

**Arjuna:**
O Mighty-armed Krishna, I wish to understand the true nature of sanyasa. O Hrishikesha, I also wish to understand what is tyaga. O Slayer of the demon Keshi, how are these two different?

**Lord Krishna:**
Giving up of activity that one is desirous of is understood as sanyasa by the wise. Giving up the results of all activity performed is called as tyaga by those who are perceptive.
Some learned people say that all kinds of actions should be given up as evil, while others maintain that acts of yajna, dana and tapas should never be given up.
Now here my conclusion on the subject of tyaga, O best of Bharatas. O ferocious among men, tyaga is known to be of three kinds.
Actions of yajna, dana and tapas should never be abandoned. They must certainly be performed. Indeed, acts of yajna, charity and penance are purifying even for those who are wise.
These activities must be performed without attachment and expectation for results. O Partha, this is my definite and highest opinion.
One's prescribed duties should never be renounced. Such deluded renunciation is said to be in the mode of tamas.
To give up prescribed duties because they are troublesome or cause bodily discomfort is renunciation in the mode of rajas. Such renunciation never leads to any benefit.
When actions that need to be performed are performed regularly, O Arjuna, by renouncing one's entanglements to the result and the result itself, such renunciation is considered to be in the mode of sattva.
The one who neither hates unpleasant activity, nor loves pleasant activity, such an enlightened person is a true renunciant, who is filled with sattva, whose dilemmas are broken.
It is not possible for an embodied being to renounce activity entirely. The one who renounces the results of one's activity is said to be a true renunciant.
The result of activity is of three kinds, pleasant, unpleasant and mixed. This is applicable even after leaving the body, but only to those who are non-renunciants. There are no such distinctions for renunciants.
O mighty-armed Arjuna, learn about these five factors that are a cause for all activity. These are identified, after considering everything, as the factors that are responsible for the accomplishment of all activity.
The physical body, the doer, the various senses, the many kinds of efforts and divine grace, these are the five factors of all activity.
These five are the contributory factors for whatever action is performed, whether proper or improper, with body, speech or mind.
And among these, the one who only considers oneself as the sole cause of activity, such a person, with a deluded mind, doesn't perceive things the way they are.
The one who is free from ego, and whose mind doesn't get entangled, such a person, even after causing a disturbance in the world, is not bound by that disturbance.
Knowledge, the object of knowledge, and the knower, these are the three factors that induce action. The instrument of action, the act itself, and the doer, these are the three constituents of action.
Knowledge, action, and the doer are declared to be of three kinds by taking into consideration the modes of materialistic nature. Here now, as to how they are classified exactly. Understand that knowledge to be in the mode of sattva, by which a person sees one undivided imperishable self within all diverse living beings.
Know that knowledge to be in the mode of rajas, by which one sees the many four living entities in diverse bodies as individual and unconnected.
That knowledge is said to be in the mode of tamas, which is only interested in the performance of activity without any heed to the cause, and does not consider the possibility of an all-encompassing truth.
Action that is measured and appropriate, which is free from liking and aversion, and which is done without desire for rewards, is said to be in the mode of sattva.
Action that is prompted by selfish desire, enacted with pride, and full of stress, is said to be in the mode of rajas.
That activity which is taken up due to delusion, which causes entanglement, violence and self-decay, without any consideration to one's own well-being, is said to be in the mode of tamas.
The performer of activity is said to be in the mode of sattva, when one is free from egotism and entanglement, endowed with enthusiasm and determination, and is equanimous in success and failure.
The performer of activity, who is filled with passion, and a strong desire for results, who is miserly, violent-natured, impure, and easily swayed by joy and sorrow, is said to be in the mode of rajas.
The performer of activity, who is undisciplined, vulgar, stubborn, deceitful, lazy, sorrowful, and procrastinating, is said to be in the mode of tamas.
O Arjuna, hear now of the three distinctions of intellect and determination. O Dhananjaya, I shall now speak to you of how they are classified based on the three modes of materialistic nature.
O Partha, the intellect which understands what is proper action and what is improper action, what is duty and what is non-duty, what is to be feared and what is not to be feared, what is binding and what is liberating, is said to be in the mode of sattva.
That intellect which gets confused between that which is righteous and that which isn't, and cannot distinguish between right and wrong conduct, is said to be in the mode of rajas.
That intellect which is shrouded in darkness, and is convinced that what is improper is proper, perceiving untruth to be truth, is of the nature of tamas.
The steadfast focus that is developed through yoga, and which sustains the activities of the mind, the life force, and the senses, is said to be in the mode of sattva.
The steadfast focus by which one holds to duty, pleasures, and wealth, out of attachment and desire for rewards, is said to be in the mode of rajas.
That steadfast focus of an unintelligent mind, in which one holds on to dreaming, fearing, grieving, hopelessness, and conceit, is said to be in the mode of tamas.
And now hear from me, O Arjuna, of the three kinds of happiness in which the embodied soul rejoices, and can even reach the end of all suffering.
That which seems like poison at first, but in time, transforms to something better than nectar itself, is said to be the happiness in the mode of sattva. It is generated by the intellect that is situated in the true knowledge of the self.
That happiness which seems to be greater than nectar, due to the indulgence of the sense organs in the objects of the senses, but in time, turns out to be poison, is said to be in the mode of rajas.
That happiness which covers the nature of the self, from beginning to end, and which is derived from sleep, laziness and negligence, is said to be in the mode of tamas.
No living being on earth, or the higher celestial abodes in this material realm, is free from the influence of these three modes of nature.
The activities of the Brahmanas, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas and the Shudras are distributed according to their qualities, born out of the nature of their selves.
Tranquility, self-restraint, austerity, purity, patience, integrity, knowledge, wisdom and pursuit of the beyond are the natural qualities of work for a Brahmana.
Valour, strength, fortitude, skill in weaponry, resolve, never retreating from battle, large-heartedness in charity, and leadership abilities, these are the natural qualities of work for the Kshatriyas.
Agriculture, cattle rearing and commerce are the natural qualities of work for Vaishyas, while serving others through work, for a pay in return, is the natural quality of work for the Shudras.
By fulfilling their duties, born out of their innate qualities, human beings can attain to perfection. Now hear from me, as to how one can become perfect, by discharging one's prescribed duties. By worshipping that from which the natures of all creatures are born, and that which pervades all of creation, a human being gains attainment.
Even if one has lower tendencies, following one's own dharma, leads to a greater well-being, than following a dharma that does not belong to oneself. One does not falter by performing activity that is natural to one's own self.
O son of Kunti, even if it is faulty, activity born out of one's true nature must never be forfeited. Indeed, all activity is covered with some faults, as fire is covered by smoke.
The one who is disentangled from everything, with complete control over the self and the senses, shall attain to that ultimate state of renunciation, where one need not perform any further action to attain.
O son of Kunti, hear from me as to how someone attains to the state of all-pervading Brahman. I shall speak to you completely of this ultimate process of attaining to knowledge.
By being united with a clear mind, and by restraining oneself with a steadfast focus, by getting rid of the indulgence in the objects of the senses, and by setting aside liking and aversion,
A person who relishes solitude, consumes in moderation, constantly in control of one's speech, body and mind, one who is constantly engaged in the yoga of meditation, and consciously practices dispassion,
By being free from egotism, violence, arrogance, desire, possessiveness of property and selfishness, a person situated in tranquillity becomes fit to be united with the all-pervading nature of the universe, called Brahman.
The one who is situated in the transcendental Brahman, becomes mentally serene. Such a person neither grieves nor desires. By being equanimous towards all living beings, such a yogi attains supreme devotion unto me. Such a person realizes the true extent of me with the help of devotion. Then, having known me completely, such a person becomes one with me. Even while performing all kinds of activities, such a person takes constant refuge in me. By my grace, one attains to the eternal and imperishable abode of the Self.
O Arjuna, dedicate your every activity to me, making me your supreme goal. Resort to the yoga of the intellect, and keep your consciousness absorbed in me always. Once you are absorbed in the true sense of me, you shall overcome all obstacles through my grace. But if you act with a false sense of identity, you shall not attain to well-being and shall perish. If, due to false sense of identity, you think of abandoning this world, it will only be an illusion. Your intrinsic nature will put you back in this path inevitably.
O son of Kunti, you are anyways bound by activity that is born out of your intrinsic nature. Even if you do not wish to fight at the moment due to the current dilemma, you will eventually end up being driven towards it.
O Arjuna, the Lord that rules over the self is situated at the location of the heart. That Lord directs all the activity of an embodied being like a machine through the energy of Maya.
Take refuge in that Lord by all means, O Bharata. Through the grace of that Lord, you shall attain to perfect and eternal inner peace.
Thus, I have explained to you this knowledge, which is more secretive than all secrets. Ponder over it completely, and then perform activity as you please.
Hear again of the essence of all my speech, which is the most confidential of all knowledge. I reveal this for your benefit, because you are very dear to me.
Always think of me, be devoted to me, and worship me. In doing so, you will certainly attain to me. This is my confirmation to you, for you are very dear to me.
Abandon all dharmas and take refuge in me. I shall liberate you from all sinful reactions. Do not fear.
This instruction should never be explained to those who are not austere, or to those who are not devoted. It should also not to be spoken to, to those who are unwilling, and especially not to those who have ill intentions.
Those who grant this greatest knowledge among my devotees, perform the greatest act of devotion. They shall attain to me without a doubt.
No human being does more loving service to me than they. Nor shall there ever be anyone on this earth more dear to me.
And I think that those who study this auspicious dialogue of ours, will grow dear towards me through the yajna of knowledge.
Even a person who just listens to this knowledge, with a steadfast focus, and without envy, will be liberated from sins, and shall attain to auspicious abodes where the pious dwell.
O Arjuna, have you heard all that I have said, with a focused mind? Have your ignorance and delusion been destroyed?

**Arjuna:**
O Achyuta, my illusion has been dispelled, and I have attained to knowledge. I am now free from doubts, and I shall act according to your instructions.

**Narrator:**
Thus have I heard this wonderful conversation between Vasudeva and Partha, which is causing me goosebumps.
By the blessing of sage Vyasa, I have heard this supreme and most secretive yoga, from the lord of yoga, Lord Krishna himself.
As I repeatedly recall this astonishing and wonderful dialogue between Keshava and Arjuna, O king, I rejoice again and again.
And by repeatedly remembering that astonishing and wonderful cosmic form of Lord Krishna, I am filled with wonder, and thrilled with joy, over and over again.
Wherever there is Lord Krishna, the master of yoga, and wherever there is Partha, with his bow ready, there will certainly be prosperity, victory and abundance. Of this I am certain.
And thus ends the 18th chapter, by the name of Moksha Sanyasa Yogah. This is taken from Shrimad Bhagavad Gita, a conversation between Lord Krishna and Arjuna, on the science of yoga, which is the knowledge of ultimate reality, called as Brahma-vidya.
OM SHRI PARAMATMANE NAMAH. I bow down to the supreme consciousness.
Om Shantakaram Bhujagashayanam Padmanabham Suresham Vishvadharam Gaganasadrisham Meghavarnam Shubhangam Lakshmikantam Kamalanayanam Yogibhirdhyanagamyam Vande Vishnum Bhavabhayaharam Sarvalokaikanatham.
