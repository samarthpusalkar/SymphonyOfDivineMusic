### **Bhagavad Gita - Chapter 11: Vishwarupa Darshana Yoga**

**Narrator:**
I bow down to the Supreme Consciousness, and now we start the holy Bhagavad Gita. This starts the eleventh chapter of Bhagavad Gita, called Vishwarupa Darshana Yoga. After having heard the glories of the divine state of existence of Lord Krishna, Arjuna then spoke thus.

**Arjuna:**
Through the words that you have spoken for my benefit, describing the highest and well preserved science of realizing the Self, my delusion has been removed.
The cycles of creation and dissolution of all creatures has been heard by me in complete detail. From you, O lotus eyed one, I have received the knowledge of this great unchanging truth.
O Lord, I wish to realize the form of your divine state of existence, the way you have described it to me. If you feel that it is possible for me to realize this, O Lord of Yoga, then please make me see the true nature of this unchanging Self.

**Lord Krishna:**
O Partha, behold hundreds, if not thousands, of my divine manifestations, which are of varying shapes, sizes and colors.
O descendant of the Bharatas, see that I and the twelve sons of Aditi, the eight Vasus, the eleven Rudras, the two Ashwini Kumaras, as well as the forty-nine Maruths. See all of these wondrous manifestations, which have never been seen before.
O Gudakesha, watch all aspects of creation, both mobile and immobile, present here and now. Whatever else you wish to see, notice that it is all in my own form.
It is not possible to see the true extent of me with these physical eyes. I now grant you divine vision. Behold the glory of my Yoga.

**Narrator:**
And then Dhritarashtra's minister Sanjaya, who has been narrating the on-goings at the battlefield of Kurukshetra, addressed his king thus.
O King, having spoken thus, the highest Lord of Yoga, Sri Hari, displayed His divine and opulent form to Arjuna. A form of many faces and eyes, decorated with many celestial ornaments and wielding many kinds of divine weapons. A form adorned in many garlands and anointed with many fragrances. An awe-inducing form of the divine, which is endless and all-pervading.
If a thousand suns were to blaze forth together in the sky, that brilliance might be comparable to the radiance of this form. And there Arjuna could see the totality of the entire universe with its varied manifestations established in one place, in that body of the God of Gods.
Then Arjuna, full of wonder, with his hair standing on end, bowed down with folded hands before the Lord and addressed Him thus. Arjuna then spoke the following words.

**Arjuna:**
O Lord, I behold within your body all the gods and multitudes of different kinds of beings. I see Lord Brahma seated on a lotus, all the sages and the celestial serpents.
I see your infinite form in every direction, with countless arms, stomachs, faces and eyes. O Lord of the universe, whose form is the universe itself, I do not see your beginning, middle or end.
I see your form adorned with a crown and armed with a gada and chakraha, a form that looks like a huge heap of pure brilliance shining in all directions. I see your form which shines like the blazing fire of the sun, a form that is extremely hard to realize.
I recognize you as the imperishable sense of self that ought to be realized, the ultimate truth to be known by the scriptures. I see you as that which supports all of creation. You are the eternal protector of dharma, and you are the everlasting divinity.
I look at your form which has no beginning, middle or end, a form that is of endless potential, endless capabilities, with the sun and the moon as your eyes. I see your mouth that resembles a fire that is ablaze. I see your form which spreads warmth to the entire creation by its radiance.
The space between the sky and earth, and all the directions, are pervaded by you alone. Seeing your wondrous and terrible form, I see the three worlds trembling in fear, O greatest of beings.
All the celestial gods are taking refuge in you by entering into you. Awestruck, some are praising you with folded hands. The great sages and enlightened beings are extolling your virtue with auspicious words of praise and prayer.
The Rudras, Adityas, Vasus, Sadhyas, Vishwadevas, Ashvini Kumaras, Maruts, Ancestors, Yakshas, Asuras and Siddhas are all gazing upon you in wonder.
O mighty Lord, in veneration of your magnificent form, with its many mouths, eyes, arms, thighs, legs, stomachs and terrifying teeth, all the worlds are terror-stricken, and so am I.
O Lord Vishnu, looking at your form of multiple brilliant colours that seem to be touching the sky, with mouths wide open and enormous blazing eyes, my heart is trembling with fear. I have lost all courage and peace of mind.
Having seen your many mouths bearing your terrible teeth, resembling the raging fire at the time of annihilation, I forget where I am and do not know where to go. O Lord of Lords, you are the refuge of the universe. Please have compassion towards me.
All the sons of Dhritarashtra, along with their allied kings, including Bhishma, Dronacharya, Karna and also the generals from our side, and the important warriors. I see them rushing headlong into your fearsome mouths. I see some with their bodies broken and heads smashed between your terrible teeth.
As the waters of rivers flow rapidly into the ocean, so do these great warriors enter into your blazing mouths. As moths rush with great speed into the fire to perish, so do these armies enter with great speed into your mouths.
With your fiery tongues, you are licking up the vast group of living beings on all sides and devouring them with your blazing mouths. O Vishnu, you are scorching the entire universe with the fears, all-pervading rays of your brilliance.
Tell me who you are, O fierce one. O God of Gods, I bow down before you. Please bestow your mercy upon me. You who existed before all of creation, I wish to know who you are, for I do not comprehend your nature or activity. You who existed before all of creation, I wish to know who you are, for I do not comprehend your nature or activity.

**Lord Krishna:**
I am mighty Kaala, the force of destruction that comes forth to annihilate all the worlds. Even without your participation, the warriors fighting in the opposite army shall cease to exist.
Therefore, arise and attain honor. Conquer your force and enjoy prosperous rulership. These warriors have already been slain by me and you will only be an instrument of my work, O Arjuna.
Dronacharya, Bhishma, Jayadratha, Karna and other brave warriors have already been killed by me. So slay them without being disturbed. Just fight and you will be victorious over your enemies in the battlefield.

**Narrator:**
And then the Minister Sanjaya spoke, After hearing these words of Keshava, Arjuna trembled with dread. With folded palms, he bowed down before Lord Krishna and spoke in a faltering voice, overwhelmed with fear. Arjuna spoke the following words.

**Arjuna:**
O Master of the senses, it is only apt that the universe rejoices in your praise and is enamoured by you. Demons flee from you in fear in all directions, and the enlightened saints bow down to you.
O great one who is even greater than Brahma himself, why would they not bow down to you? O limitless one, O Lord of the Devas, O refuge of the universe, you are the imperishable reality beyond both the manifest and the unmanifest.
You are the embodiment of prime divinity and the true sense of self that lies within. You are the soul resting place of this universe. You are both the knower and the object of knowledge. You are the supreme abode.
O Lord who possesses infinite forms, you alone pervade the entire universe. You are Virili Vayu, Yama, Agni, Varuna and Chandra. You are the creator Brahma and the great grandfather of all beings.
I bow down to you a thousand times, again and yet again. O Lord of infinite potential, I bow down to you from the front and the rear. I bow down to you from all the directions. You are the one of infinite valor who pervades all of creation and the great grandfather of all beings.
You are the supreme abode. You are the supreme abode. You are the supreme abode. You are the supreme abode. You are the supreme abode of all creation and thus are the very creation itself.
Thinking of you as my friend, I presumptiously addressed you as O Krishna, O Yadava, O dear friend, O Krishna, O Yādava, O dear friend, I was ignorant of your grace, and showed negligence and undue affection towards you.
And if in ignorant jest I treated you with disrespect, while playing, resting, sitting, eating, when alone or before others, for all of it I crave forgiveness.
You are the father of the entire universe of all moving and non-moving beings. You are the most deserving of worship and the supreme spiritual master. When there is none equal to you in all the three worlds, then who can possibly be greater than you?
Therefore, O Lord, bowing deeply and prostrating before You, I implore You for Your grace. As a father tolerates his son, a friend forgives his friend, and a lover pardons the beloved. Please forgive me for my offenses.
Having seen Your universal form that I had never seen before, I feel great joy, and yet my mind trembles in fear. Please show me compassion and appear again in Your pleasing form, O God of gods, O abode of the universe.
O thousand-armed one, though you are the embodiment of all creation, I wish to see you in your four-armed form, carrying the gada and chakraha, adorned in a majestic crown.

**Lord Krishna:**
O Arjuna, you have witnessed this ultimate form of mine, due to my grace, a form that is an embodiment of brilliance, all-encompassing and previously unseen.
O warrior of the Kuru dynasty, one cannot get to realize this form of mine through the Vedas, yajñas, studies or charities. Neither can this be realized even through the fiercest of kriyas and austerities.
Do not be afraid or bewildered upon seeing this terrible form of mine. Be free from fear, and with a cheerful heart, behold me once again in my pleasing form.

**Narrator:**
And then Sanjaya spoke the following words. O warrior of the Kuru dynasty, one cannot get to realize this form of mine, due to my grace, having spoken thus, the compassionate son of Vāsudeva displayed his pleasing four-armed form. Then he further consoled the frightened Arjuna by assuming his gentle two-armed form.

**Arjuna:**
O Krishna, upon seeing your gentle human form, I have regained my composure, and my mind is restored to normalcy.

**Lord Krishna:**
That form of mine which you have seen is exceedingly difficult to behold. Even the celestial gods are eager to see it.
Neither by the study of Vedas, nor by penance, charity or yajñas, can I be seen as you have seen me. O Arjuna, only by unparalleled devotion can I be known thus. That is the only method to know, see and be one with me.
A person who performs activity for me is devoted to me, who is disentangled and has no malice towards all creatures. Such a person shall attain to me, O Pandava.

**Narrator:**
And thus ends the eleventh chapter by the name Vishwa Rupa Darshana Yoga. This is taken from Shrimad Bhagavad Gita, a conversation between Lord Krishna and Arjuna on the science of yoga, which is the knowledge of ultimate reality called as Brahma Vidya.
