### **Bhagavad Gita - Chapter 2: Sankhya Yoga**

**Narrator:**
I bow down to the Supreme Consciousness. And now, we start the holy Bhagavad Gita. Thus starts the second chapter of Bhagavad Gita, which describes Sankhya Yoga, where Lord Krishna analyzes the nature of being human. King Dhritarashtra's minister Sanjaya continued to narrate the on-goings of war at the battlefield of Kurukshetra. Sanjaya said, O King Dhritarashtra, after Arjuna collapsed into his chariot, overwhelmed with grief and suffering over having to go to war against his own men, Lord Krishna looked at the pitiful state of Arjuna and spoke the following words.

**Lord Krishna:**
O Arjuna, from where has this delusion entered you at this critical time? It is not befitting of your honor. This confusion of yours is only going to harm your pleasantness and your reputation.

O Partha, do not give in to cowardliness. It does not suit you well. Give up such petty weakness of heart and arise.

**Arjuna:**
O Madhusudana, how could I ever fight against the men I worship like Bhishma and Dronacharya? How could I shoot them down with my arrows in this battle? It would be better to live in this world by begging for alms than to enjoy life with wealth and pleasures earned at the cost of spilling my Guru's blood.

I am no longer sure which is a better end result, us winning or them winning. Those very people are in this battle by killing whom we ourselves cannot stay alive. I am confused about my duty and am struck with anxiety and fear. I am here now as your disciple and I surrender myself to you. Please instruct me as to what is the best course of action for me.

I can find no means of driving away this anguish that is drying up my senses. Even if I acquire wealth, progeny and vast kingdoms on earth, even if I acquire dominion over gods themselves, I do not see how I could quell this grief.

**Narrator:**
Sanjaya then said the following words to Dhritarashtra. Having thus spoken to Lord Krishna, Arjuna added, O Govinda, I shall not fight any more, and fell silent. And then, standing in the middle of both the armies, Lord Krishna smilingly spoke the following words to the grief-stricken Arjuna.

**Lord Krishna:**
O Arjuna, you mourn that which is not worthy of mourning, and on top of that you are hiding behind words that seem intelligent. The wise do not lament that which has already happened in the past, nor that which has not yet happened.

Never was there a time when I did not exist, nor you, nor all these kings, nor in the future shall any of us cease to exist. Just as the Self or Atma within the body continuously passes from childhood to youth, and then to old age, similarly, at the time of death, the Self passes on into another body, and then to the next life. The wise are not deluded by this.

O son of Kunti, the contact between the senses and the sense objects gives rise to fleeting perceptions of happiness and distress. These are non-permanent and are constantly changing, like heat and cold. O descendant of Bharata, one must learn to tolerate these effects without being disturbed by them.

O Arjuna, the noblest among men, that person who is not adversely affected by happiness or distress, and remains steady in both, becomes eligible for liberation. That which is untrue has no existence. That which is true can never disappear. The nature of these both has been realized by those who perceive truth.

O Arjuna, the noblest among men, that person who is not adversely affected by happiness or distress, these bodies which come with an end date belong to that eternal Self. These bodies belong to that which is indestructible, immeasurable and eternal. Therefore, fight, O descendant of Bharata.

The one who thinks of the Self as the killer or the one who thinks the Self as the killed, neither of them realize that the Self can neither kill nor be killed. The Self is neither born, nor does it ever die, nor having ever existed, does it ever cease to exist. The Self is without birth, eternal, immortal and ageless. It is not destroyed when the body is destroyed.

O Partha, the one who knows the Self to be imperishable, eternal, unborn and immutable, whom shall he harm or whom shall he kill? As a person sheds worn-out garments and puts on new ones, similarly at the time of death, the Self casts off its worn-out body and enters a new one.

Weapons cannot shred the Self, nor can fire burn it. Water cannot wet it, nor can the wind dry it. The Self is unbreakable and incombustible. It can neither be dampened nor dried up. It is everlasting in all places, unalterable, immutable and primordial. The Self is spoken of as invincible, inconceivable and unchangeable. Knowing this, you should not grieve for the body.

If, however, you think that the Self is subject to constant birth and death, O mighty armed Arjuna, even then you should not grieve like this. Death is certain for one who has been born, and rebirth is inevitable for one who has died. Therefore you should not lament over the inevitable.

O descendant of Bharata, all created beings have no presence felt before birth. They come to exist in life and again have no presence after death. Then where is the cause for grief in this constant cycle? Some see the Self with surprise, some describe it as surprising, and some hear of the Self as surprising, while others, even after hearing the truth, cannot know it at all.

O Arjuna, the Self that dwells within the body is immortal. Therefore you should not mourn for anyone. Besides, considering your dharma as a warrior, you should not falter. In fact, for a warrior, there is no better activity that leads to well-being than fighting for upholding of dharma.

O Partha, happy are those warriors to whom such opportunities and dharma come unsought. This activity opens for them a stairway to Swarga. However, if you refuse to fight in this war for dharma, if you abandon your social duty and reputation, you will certainly incur sin. People will speak of you as a coward and a deserter. For a respectable person, infamy is worse than death.

The great generals who hold you in high esteem will think that you fled from the battlefield out of fear and thus will lose their respect for you. Your enemies will defame and humiliate you with unkind words insulting your might. What could be more painful than that?

If you fight, you will either be slain on the battlefield and attain Swarga or you will be victorious and enjoy the kingdom on earth. Therefore, arise with determination O son of Kunti and be prepared to fight. Keep your mind equanimous in happiness or distress, loss or gain, victory or defeat. Participate in this war this way and you will not incur sin.

So far, I have explained to you Sankhya Yoga or analytic knowledge regarding the nature of the self. Now, O Partha, listen carefully as I reveal Buddhi Yoga or the Yoga of intellect. When you work with such understanding, you will be freed from the bondage of Karma. Working in this state of consciousness, there is no loss or adverse result and even a little effort saves one from great danger.

O descendant of the Kurus, the intellect of those who are steadfast is focused and their aim is one-pointed. But the intellect of those who are not steadfast is many-branched. Those with limited understanding get attracted to only the flowery words of the Vedas. They are only interested in rituals promising worldly well-being and presume that no higher principle is described in them. They glorify only those portions of the Vedas that please their senses and perform pompous ritualistic ceremonies for attaining worldly progress. Their minds are deeply attached to worldly pleasures and their intellects are bewildered by such things. Hence, they are unable to possess the determination to bring their intellect to a state of equanimity.

The Vedas deal with the three modes of material nature, O Arjuna. Rise above these three modes to a state of pure consciousness. Freeing yourself from dualities, eternally fixed in truth and without concern for survival and prosperity, be steadfast and situated in the Self. To a person who has realized, Vedas offer the same value as that of a small well of water to someone who has access.

You have control only on the actions that you perform, never on the end result of the action. Do not focus on being the cause of a result; at the same time, do not give up on activity completely.

Establish yourself in yoga and then perform activity, O Arjuna. Be equanimous in success or failure. Equanimity is yoga.

Reward-seeking activity is inferior by a long shot to activity performed through Buddhi-Yoga. Seek refuge in an equanimous intellect. Those who perform activity while being focused on the result are miserly.

One who performs activity with an equanimous mind wins over the dualities of good and bad action. Hence strive for yoga, O Arjuna. Yoga is dexterity in action.

Those who perform activity with an equanimous mind, abandoning their entanglement to the fruits of their action, they are liberated from the very cycles of life and death and attain the state beyond all suffering.

When your intellect crosses the dangerous swamp of delusion, you will then have no more need to know that which has been heard and that which is yet to be heard.

When your intellect stops being enticed by the result-oriented sections of the Vedas and remains steadfast in divine consciousness, you will then attain the state of yoga.

**Arjuna:**
O Keshava, what is the disposition of one who is situated in divine consciousness? How does an enlightened person talk? How does he sit? How does he walk?

**Lord Krishna:**
O Partha, when one discards all selfish desires and cravings of the senses that torment the mind and becomes satisfied in the realization of the Self, such a person is said to be established in pure perception.

One whose mind remains undisturbed amidst misery, who does not lose control of his senses during pleasure, and who is free from entanglement, fear and anger, such a person is called a sage with an established mind. One who remains unentangled under all conditions, and is neither delighted by good fortune nor dejected by sufferings, such a person is a sage with an established perception.

One who is able to withdraw the senses from their sense objects, just as a tortoise withdraws its limbs into its shell, such a person is said to have an established perception. Those who aspire towards this state of perception may restrain the senses from their objects of enjoyment, but the taste for the sense objects remains. However, even this taste ceases to exist for those who realize the Supreme.

The senses are so strong and turbulent, O son of Kunti, that they can forcibly carry away the mind, even of a person endowed with discrimination, who practices self-control. The one who has absolute control over all the senses with one's mind ever absorbed in Me, such a person is said to have an established perception.

While contemplating on the objects of the senses, one develops entanglement towards them. Entanglement leads to desire, and unfulfilled desire leads to anger. Anger leads to clouded judgment, which in turn results in confusion of the memory. When one's memory is bewildered, the intellect gets destroyed. When one's intellect is destroyed, one is ruined.

But one who controls the mind, and is free from entanglement and aversion, even while using the objects of the senses, such a person attains to Divine grace. By Divine grace comes the peace, in which all sorrows end, and the intellect of such a person of tranquil mind, soon becomes firmly established in the Divine.

But an undisciplined person, who has not controlled the mind and senses, can neither have a resolute intellect, nor steady contemplation on the Divine. For one who never unites the mind with the Divine, there is no peace. And how can one who lacks peace be happy?

Just as a strong wind sweeps a boat off of its chartered course on the waters, senses sweep away the mind of a person who is indulged in the sense objects. O Arjuna, therefore, one who has restrained the senses from their objects, is firmly established in pure perception.

What all beings consider as day is the night of ignorance for the wise, and what all creatures see as night is the day for the introspective sage. Just as the ocean remains undisturbed by the incessant flow of waters from rivers merging into it, likewise, the sage who is unmoved despite the flow of desirable objects all around him, attains peace. Not the person who strives to satisfy the cravings for these sense objects.

That person who gives up all material desires and lives free from a sense of greed, possession and egocentrism, such a person attains perfect peace. O Partha, such is the state of an enlightened self that having attained it, one is never again deluded. Being established in this consciousness, even at the hour of death, one is liberated from the cycle of life and death and dissolves into supreme consciousness.

**Narrator:**
And thus ends the second chapter by the name of Sankhya Yoga. This is taken from Srimad Bhagavad Gita, a conversation between Lord Krishna and Arjuna on the science of yoga, which is the knowledge of ultimate reality called as Brahma Vidya.
