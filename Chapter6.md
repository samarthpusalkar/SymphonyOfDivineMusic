### **Bhagavad Gita - Chapter 6: The Yoga of Self-Control**

**Narrator:**
I bow down to the Supreme Consciousness. And now we start the Holy Bhagavad Gita. Thus starts the sixth chapter of Bhagavad Gita, where Lord Krishna describes the process of gaining mastery over one's own self.

**Lord Krishna:**
Someone who performs activity that needs to be done, without fixating on the results, is a true yogi and a sage, not someone who merely stopped performing all external or internal activity.
O son of Pandu, know that what is talked about as renunciation, is the same as yoga. No one becomes a true yogi, without renouncing the desire for results of action.
Equanimous activity is the means to climb on the path towards yoga. Once someone is established in yoga, renunciation is the means to liberation.
When one is neither attached to sense objects, nor to actions, such a person, who has renounced all desires for the fruits of actions, is said to be elevated in the path of yoga.
One should always elevate oneself, and not degrade oneself. You can be the best friend to your own self, or your own worst enemy.
The self is the best friend for such a person, who is victorious over one's own compulsions. For one who has no control over one's own compulsions of the self, it is one's own worst enemy.
The divine is established in such a person, who has won over one's own self. Such a person is at peace within, amidst dualities of hot and cold, pleasure and pain, or honor and shame.
Such a person, who is content with true knowledge of the self, who is victorious over one's own senses, and perceives either gold or stone with the same perspective, is said to be a true yogi.
Such a person, who looks upon all well-wishers, friends, strangers, enemies, the pious, and the sinners, with an impartial mind, such a person is considered to be distinguished among humans.
Those who seek the state of yoga, should reside in seclusion, constantly engaged in meditation, with a controlled mind and body, getting rid of desires, and possessions of enjoyment.
To practice yoga, one should settle in a fixed asana, in a sanctified place, that is neither too high nor too low, and covered with either a clean cloth, deer skin, or kusha grass. One should settle into an asana, and then, with a focused mind, one should strive to purify the knowledge of the self, by control over the sway of the senses.
By holding one's torso, neck, and head in a straight line, one should sit unmoving, and hold a steady and undisturbed focus, at the peak of one's nose.
Thus, with a serene, fearless, and unwavering mind, in steady pursuit to realize Brahman, the supreme consciousness, one should immerse oneself in the nature of the self.
And thus, a yogi, who is of a disciplined mind, should constantly try to unite with the identity of the true self. By doing so, one shall attain true inner peace of liberation, that eternally resides within me.
O Arjuna, the state of yoga is not possible for someone who consumes too much. At the same time, there is no focus for someone who doesn't consume at all. It is neither possible for a person who is overly involved in dreams and nor for someone who exerts oneself in prolonged wakefulness. For a person who consciously consumes, who consciously lets go, and performs all activity including sleep and wakefulness, consciously, the state of yoga is attained, removing all suffering. When one's disciplined mind is always established in the knowledge of the true self, such a person who is not swayed by any kind of desires is then called a yogi.
Just as a lamp is steady in the absence of breeze, so is the disciplined mind of a yogi who remains steady in meditation of the self.
Where the mind dwells in joy by absolute control brought about through yoga, there one witnesses the nature of one's true self and stays in bliss.
The one who understands the possibility of that highest state of joyfulness which is beyond the realm of the senses, such a person then starts to walk that path of self-realization steadily.
By attaining that highest gain after which there is nothing superior left to attain and in which state one doesn't get swayed even by the strongest of unpleasant situations, know that to be the state of being called yoga where there is no more suffering. A seeker should strive for such a state with certainty, without doubt and despair in the mind.
One should do so by letting go of fixating upon the desire for results of all action and by gaining total control over one's mind and all sense organs. One shall progress on this path slowly and steadily with a mind that is steady and focused. The mind should be unwavering and focused on the true knowledge of the Self. Whenever and wherever the restless and unsteady mind wanders, one should bring it back and continuously focus it within one's own self. Ultimate bliss is attained by such a yogi who is of a calm mind, who has pacified his need for action, and who is rid of his false sense of self. Such a yogi who is rid of his false identity, who is always immersed in the true knowledge of the Self, enjoys utmost bliss which in other words is true contact with divinity itself. Such a being who is established in the state of yoga is of an equanimous perception and sees one's own self in all living beings and all living beings within one's own self. Such a person who sees me in everything and sees everything within myself, I am not lost for such a person and such a person is not lost to me. When such a person who is established in this unity with everything meditates upon me, one constantly resides in my own self despite being engaged in all kinds of activities. Such a yogi who is empowered by the knowledge of the true self, who looks upon pleasantness or unpleasantness with the same perspective, is said to be of the highest order.

**Narrator:**
Arjuna, who was unable to grasp this teaching of Lord Krishna, expressed his doubts thus:

**Arjuna:**
Oh Madhusudana, I don't see how this state of yoga that you have described can be achieved. I don't see how I can practice this method of equanimity because my mind is wandering constantly. The mind is extremely restless, turbulent, strong and obstinate, O Krishna. It feels to me that it is more difficult to control the mind than to control the wind.

**Narrator:**
Lord Krishna then replied thus:

**Lord Krishna:**
O mighty-armed son of Kunti, undoubtedly it is very difficult to control the mind. It can only be brought about by repeated practice and through disidentification with passions. I think it is impossible for someone who does not work towards equanimity to attain yoga. However, for someone who has attained mastery over one's own self, it is very much a possibility that can be attained through the right practices.

**Narrator:**
Arjuna then had a question which he expressed thus:

**Arjuna:**
O Krishna, if someone starts on the path of yoga but then gives up the practice and gets off track, what will happen to such a person who doesn't attain the final objective? Will such a person be deprived of both material security as well as spiritual success? Will someone who started on the path of yoga but left it midway dissipate like a cloud which neither retained its form nor poured down as rain? O Krishna, please dispel this doubt of mine completely. I do not see who else can answer this question apart from you.

**Narrator:**
Then Lord Krishna replied:

**Lord Krishna:**
O Partha, there is no harm for such a person in the material or the spiritual realm. The one who performs auspicious action doesn't attain to inauspicious outcome. Someone who strayed from the pursuit of yoga midway will enjoy the benefits of one's impermanent outcome of one's actions and then be born again in a home of auspicious and prosperous people. Otherwise, they shall be born into a house of attained yogis. This kind of a birth is very difficult to attain in this world.
And there, O descendant of Kurus, such people regain the knowledge belonging to the bodies of previous lifetimes. They then continue their seeking with renewed effort due to the practice they put in during previous lifetimes. They get drawn towards this path as if beyond their control. A seeker of this path of yoga goes beyond the materialistic manifestations of creation. Such a yogi who continuously gets rid of his false identities through multiple lifetimes of continued preparation and effort attains to the ultimate state of pure consciousness. A yogi is superior to a tapasvi (an ascetic), a jnani (a person of knowledge), and even superior to a karmi (a person of action). Therefore, O Arjuna, strive to be a yogi. Even among all the yogis, those whose minds are always absorbed in me and who are constantly established in my very sense of self, them I consider to be of the highest order.

**Narrator:**
And thus ends the sixth chapter by the name of Atma Sanyama Yoga. This is taken from Shrimad Bhagavad Gita, a conversation between Lord Krishna and Arjuna, on the science of yoga, which is the knowledge of ultimate reality, called as Brahma-vidya.
OM SHRI PARAMATMANE NAMAHA.
