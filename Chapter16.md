### **Bhagavad Gita - Chapter 16: The Yoga of Divine and Demonic Natures**

**Narrator:**
I bow down to the Supreme Consciousness, and now we start the holy Bhagavad Gita.
After expounding upon the true nature of eternal Purusha, Lord Krishna goes on to explain various qualities which elevate one to a divine state of being and which deplete one to a demonic state of existence.

**Lord Krishna:**
Fearlessness, purity of mind, steadfastness in the true knowledge of the Self, charity, control of the senses, austerity and simplicity, non-violence, truthfulness, absence of outrage, renunciation, peacefulness, restraint from fault-finding, compassion towards all living beings, absence of greed, gentleness, modesty and lack of fickleness, brilliance, forgiveness, fortitude, cleanliness, bearing no enmity towards anyone, and absence of vanity.
These are the qualities of someone who lives in exalted and divine state of existence, O descendant of Bharata.

O Partha, the qualities of those who possess a demonic nature are hypocrisy, arrogance, conceit, outrage, harshness and ignorance.
The divine qualities lead to liberation, while the demonic qualities lead to continued bondage to limitations.
Grieve not, O Arjuna, as you are equipped with divine qualities.

There are two kinds of beings in this world, those who live in a divine state of being, and those who live in a demonic state of existence.
I have described the divine qualities in detail, O Arjuna. Now hear from me about the demonic nature.

Those of a demonic nature do not comprehend which actions are proper and which are improper. Hence, they possess neither purity nor good conduct, and not even truthfulness.
Such people say that there is no law that governs all of existence. All beings are not interdependent of each other, and there is no other causative force in existence other than sexual gratification.
By being established in such perception, such people of lower intellect are lost to the knowledge of their own true selves. This leads to them performing harmful activity, which leads to the downfall of the world.

They take refuge in lust, which can never be fulfilled, and get afflicted with pride, arrogance, and hypocrisy. In such delusion, they are attracted towards that which is untruth and impermanent, and act in impurity. They are then afflicted with immeasurable misery, anxiety, and death.
They constantly seek material gratification as they come to a conclusion that it is all that exists. They are bound in hundreds of ropes of desire, and are driven by lust and rage. They strive to accumulate wealth by unjust means, all for the gratification of their senses.

They constantly indulge in the thoughts of, "I have gained so much wealth today, and I shall now fulfill this desire of mine. This is mine, and tomorrow I shall have even more. That enemy has been destroyed by me, and I shall destroy the others too. I am like God Himself. I am the enjoyer. I am all-powerful, and I am happy. I am wealthy, and I have highly placed relatives. Who else is equal to me? I shall earn, I shall spend, and I shall rejoice."
In these thoughts, they are deluded by ignorance. With their minds led astray in many different directions, enveloped in a mesh of delusion, and addicted to the gratification of sensuous pleasures, they descend to a lower state of existence called hell.

Such self-conceited and stubborn people, full of pride and arrogance in their wealth, perform ostentatious acts of worship just for the name, without the right approach. Blinded by egotism, strength, arrogance, desire, and anger, those of a demonic nature abuse my presence within their own body, and in the bodies of others.
These cruel and hateful beings, the vile and vicious of humankind, I constantly hurl them into the wombs of those with similar demonic natures in the cycles of rebirth in the material world. These deluded beings take birth again and again in the demonic wombs. Failing to reach me, O Arjuna, they gradually sink to the lowest states of existence.

There are three portals that lead to the hell of self-destruction. They are lust, outrage, and greed. Therefore, one should abandon these three.
Those who are freed from the three portals of darkness, they work for the welfare of the self and thereby attain to the supreme state of being.
Those who act under the impulses of lust, discarding the prescriptions of the Shastras, they shall neither find attainment nor fulfilment, and of course not the realm of the beyond.
Therefore, let these guidelines show you the path in determining what should be done and what should not be done. Understand the Shastras and then perform your actions in this world accordingly.

And thus ends the sixteenth chapter by the name of Daivasura Sampad Vibhaga Yoga. This is taken from Shrimad Bhagavad Gita, a conversation between Lord Krishna and Arjuna on the science of Yoga, which is the knowledge of ultimate reality, called as Brahma Vidya.
