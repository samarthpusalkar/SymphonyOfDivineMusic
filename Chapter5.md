### **Bhagavad Gita - Chapter 5: The Yoga of Renunciation**

**Narrator:**
OM SHRI PARAMATMANI NAMAH. I bow down to the Supreme Consciousness.
And now, we start the holy Bhagavad Gita. Thus starts the fifth chapter of Bhagavad Gita, which describes Sannyasayogah, where Lord Krishna expounds upon that kind of activity which leads to liberation. After listening to Lord Krishna's explanation on various kinds of activity in the last chapter, Arjuna still has some doubts, which he expresses thus.

**Arjuna:**
O Krishna, you have praised the benefits of performing activity as a yajna, by being established in the state of yoga. You also said that it is best to stay without the need for any kind of activity. Which of these two lead to my well-being? Please tell me that one certain option.

**Lord Krishna:**
Both Sannyasa and Karma Yoga lead to the well-being of the self. Among these two, performing activity equanimously is a better option to giving up the need for activity.
Know that one who performs all activity without attraction or aversion is eternally liberated from all activity. One who is beyond these dualities is easily liberated from entanglement.
Only the immature speak of true knowledge and equanimous action as two different things. One who is truly established in either of these, achieves the results of both.
That supreme state that is attained by true knowledge, is also attained by equanimous action. The one who sees true knowledge and equanimous action as one, sees clearly.
It is very difficult to give up the need for activity, without first learning to perform activity with equanimity. The one who is established in equanimous action, attains to the supreme state in no time.
The one who has mastered control over the senses, control over one's own self, who is equanimous, and sees one's own self in all of creation, such a person remains unentangled, even while performing activity.
The one who knows the true nature of the self, knows that it is not the self that is the doer. The nature of true self is beyond the activities of seeing, hearing, touching, smelling, moving, sleeping, breathing.
It is beyond the activities of speaking, letting go, and grasping, and even opening or closing of the eyelids. Those people with the true knowledge of the self, see that the relevance of the sense organs, is just limited to the objects of the senses.
The one who performs activity by being firmly established in consciousness, without any entanglement, such a person is free from the bondage of activity, like a water droplet on a lotus leaf.
True yogis are indulged in all kinds of activity, with their body, mind, intellect, and even the sense organs. They perform activity without entanglement, with their aim to realize pure consciousness.
The wise perform activity by letting go of their desire for results, and attain to steady peace, while the unwise get entangled in suffering, due to their desire for results of activity.
The one who is in absolute control, lets go of one's entanglement with activity. Such a person then resides in bliss, within this body of nine doorways, without being the direct or indirect cause of any activity.
The creator has not created the need to act. Neither was activity created, nor the attachment to its results. All of this is an outpouring of svabhava, or one's limited identity of self.
The creator is not involved in either sinful or virtuous deeds of any living being. True knowledge is veiled by ignorance, and all bound beings are deluded because of this.
But for those in whom this ignorance of the self is destroyed by true knowledge, that knowledge reveals everything, and brings about clarity, similar to a sunrise.
Those who are of such intellect, of such knowledge of the self, of such steadfastness, and such immersion within the true self, they are cleansed of their ignorance, and are not bound by the cycles of life and death.
With the dawning of this true knowledge, which removes all false pretenses, such people look upon everything ranging from an enlightened being, or a cow, or an elephant, or a dog, or even a dog-eater, with the same perspective.
Those whose minds are established in equanimity, such people conquer the cycles of birth and death in this very lifetime. They possess the flawless qualities of the creator, and are therefore established in divinity themselves.
Such a person, who knows divinity, and is established in it, is no longer deluded, is of a steady intellect, and doesn't get swayed by either pleasant or unpleasant results of action.
Those who are not attached to external objects of senses that bring about pleasure, who realize absolute pleasantness within their own self, only such people, who are united with divinity through yoga, experience unending happiness.
The pleasures that arise from contact with the sense-objects are only capable of bringing about unpleasantness. This is because the objects of pleasures have a beginning and an end. The truly wise do not indulge themselves in such fleeting pleasures.
Such a person who is capable of withstanding the powerful impulses brought about by lust and anger, who can win over one's urges before the body perishes, such a person experiences true bliss.
Such a person who is blissed out by the light of truth within one's own self, such a yogi attains to the divine by realizing that the true nature of the self, and the divine, are not separate.
Such sages who are rid of their ignorance, attain to divine liberation. They are rid of their confusion through a disciplined sense of self, and through devotion to the well-being of all creatures.
For such sages who have realized the nature of the self, by getting rid of their lust and anger, through constant training of the mind, liberation from material existence is both here, and hereafter. This is attained by keeping the external sense organs out of the picture, by focusing one's sight within the eyebrows, and by balancing one's inhalation and exhalation. Such a person who has trained one's sense organs, mind, and intellect, who is immersed in the pursuit of truth, attains to eternal liberation by getting rid of compulsive fear and lust. Such a person who realizes that I am the one who enjoys the fruits of all equanimous action, or yajna, that I am the lord that rules over all creation, and that I am the self which works in the interest of all creatures, attains to true internal peace.

**Narrator:**
And thus ends the fifth chapter, by the name of Sannyasa Yoga. This is taken from Shrimad Bhagavad Gita, a conversation between Lord Krishna and Arjuna, on the science of yoga, which is the knowledge of ultimate reality, called as Brahma-vidya.
