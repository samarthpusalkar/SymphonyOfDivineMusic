### **Bhagavad Gita - Chapter 3: The Yoga of Action (Karma Yoga)**

**Narrator:**
I bow down to the Supreme Consciousness, and now we start the holy Bhagavad Gita.

**Lord Krishna:**
O Arjuna, I have mentioned two paths which lead towards your ultimate well-being. The path of jñāna, or knowledge, for those inclined towards analysis. And then the path of karma, or activity, for those inclined towards action.

One cannot achieve freedom from compulsive action by merely abstaining from work. Nor can one attain perfect knowledge by giving up everything.

There is no one who can remain without performing action even for a moment. Indeed, all beings are compelled to act by their qualities born out of their gunas or intrinsic tendencies.

Those who restrain the external organs of action while their minds are still stuck to the internal senses of perception, they certainly delude themselves and are called as hypocrites.

But those karmayogis who control their internal senses of perception with the mind and then use the external organs of action, working without entanglement, they are indeed special.

And so you should always perform your activity in this way, since action is superior to inaction. If you truly stop all activity, even your very bodily maintenance will not be possible.

One must perform all activity like performing a yajña. Otherwise, work causes bondage in this material world. Therefore, O son of Kunti, perform your activity without being attached to the results.

In the beginning of creation, the creator created humankind along with pure activity and said, "Prosper in the performance of these yajñas, for they shall bestow upon you all you wish to achieve."

By your yajñas, the celestial deities will be pleased, and when they are pleased, they in turn are pleasant towards you. By this mutual cooperation between humans and the deities, prosperity will reign for all.

The deities, being satisfied by the performance of yajñas, will grant you all the desired pleasures of life. But those who enjoy what is given to them, without making offerings in return, are certainly thieves.

The spiritually minded, who consume that which is left after performing a yajña, are released from all kinds of sin. Others, who consume only for their own enjoyment, certainly consume sin alone.

All living beings subsist on food, and food is produced by rains. Rains come from the performance of yajña, and yajña is produced by the performance of activity. Know that activity is born out of the creator, and the creator is born out of that which is imperishable. Therefore, the creator is eternally present in all acts of yajña.

O Partha, those who do not follow and participate in this cosmic cycle of yajña and consumption, live only for the delight of their senses. Such a life is indeed wasted.

But those who rejoice in their own self, who are fully satisfied and content within their own self, for them there is no need for activity. For such self-realized beings, there is nothing to gain or lose, either in performing or renouncing their duties. They have no needs within them that compel them to transact with other living creatures to fulfill their self-interests.

Therefore, giving up entanglement, perform actions that need to be performed. Because by working without being attached to the results, one attains the supreme.

It is by performing their activity alone, King Janaka and others gained attainments. You should therefore act, looking at what is needed most in this world.

Whichever actions great people perform, common people perform the same. Whatever standards they set, all the world emulates.

O Partha, there is no duty for me to do in all the three worlds. Nor do I have anything to gain or attain. Yet, I am engaged in activity.

Because if I abstain from performing any activity, O Partha, all men would follow my path in all respects. If I cease to perform my activity, all these worlds would perish. I would be responsible for the dissolution that would commence and would thereby destroy all creation.

As ignorant people perform their duties with entanglement to the results, O descendant of Bharata, so should the wise act without entanglement for the sake of leading people towards the right path.

The wise should not create discord in the intellects of ignorant people who are attached to the results of their actions by inducing them to stop work. Rather, by performing their duties in an enlightened manner, they should inspire the ignorant also to do their activity.

All activities are carried out by the three modes of material nature. But in ignorance, the self which is deluded by false identification with the body, thinks of itself to be the doer.

O mighty armed Arjuna, the enlightened ones distinguish the self as being separate from the gunas and karmas. They perceive that it is only the gunas, in the form of senses and mind, that are indulged in the gunas, in the form of objects of perception, and thus they do not get entangled in them.

Those who are deluded by the operation of the gunas become attached to the results of their actions. But the wise who understand these truths should not unsettle the minds of such ignorant people who know very little.

By performing all activity as an offering to me, by constantly meditating upon me as the supreme, become free from desire and selfishness, become free from your suffering and fight.

Those who abide by these teachings of mine, with profound focus and without any resistance, they are released from the bondage of karma. But those who find friction and resistance to this teaching of mine, know that they are confused about all true knowledge and bring about their own ruin.

Even wise people act according to their natures because all living beings are propelled by their natural tendencies. What will one gain by repressing them?

The senses naturally experience entanglement and aversion to the very same sense objects. Do not be controlled by them because they are the true enemies in your path.

It is far better to perform one's inner dharma, though tinted with faults, than to perform some other dharma perfectly. In fact, it is preferable to die in pursuit of one's swadharma than to follow the path of another which is fraught with danger.

**Arjuna:**
O Krishna, the descendant of Vrishni, then why is a person led towards committing sinful acts? They seem to be propelled even if they are unwilling, as if driven by a strong force.

**Lord Krishna:**
It is due to lust and rage, kama and krodha, which are born out of contact with the mode of passion or rajoguna. Know that these two are the sinful, all devouring enemies in this world.

Just as a fire is covered by smoke, a mirror is masked by dust, and a foetus is concealed by fluid. Similarly, one's knowledge gets shrouded by these two.

O son of Kunti, the knowledge of even the most discerning of people gets covered by this perpetual enemy, the enemy in the form of insatiable desire, which is never satisfied and burns like fire.

The senses, mind and intellect are said to be the breeding grounds of desire. Through them, it clouds one's knowledge and dilutes the embodied self.

Therefore, O best of the Bharatas, at the very outset, bring the senses under control and slay this enemy called lust. This is the embodiment of sin and destroys knowledge and realization.

The senses are subtler and exist beyond the gross level of the body. The mind is subtler and beyond the senses. The intellect is subtler and beyond the mind, and the self is subtler and beyond the intellect.

Thus, knowing the self to be beyond the intellect, O mighty armed Arjuna, subdue the self that is falsely identified with senses, mind and the intellect by the strength of your own true self. Win over this formidable enemy called lust.

**Narrator:**
And thus ends the third chapter by the name of Karma Yoga. This is taken from Shrimad Bhagavad Gita, a conversation between Lord Krishna and Arjuna on the science of yoga, which is the knowledge of ultimate reality called as Brahma Vidya.
