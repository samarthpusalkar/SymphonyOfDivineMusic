### **Bhagavad Gita - Chapter 13: The Yoga of Distinction Between the Field and the Knower of the Field**

**Narrator:**
I bow down to the Supreme Consciousness.
And now, we start the holy Bhagavad Gita. Thus starts the 13th chapter of Bhagavad Gita called Kṣetrakṣetragnya-vibhāgayogaḥ.
After having heard of the means of attaining to the Divine through devotion or bhakti, Arjuna had further doubts which he expressed thus.

**Arjuna:**
O Keshava, I wish to understand what Prakriti and Purusha are, and the distinction between Kṣetra and Kṣetragnya. I also wish to know what true knowledge is and the objective of such knowledge.

**Narrator:**
Lord Krishna then replied.

**Lord Krishna:**
O Arjuna, this body is termed as Kṣetra, and the one who has the knowledge of residence within the body is called as Kṣetragnya by the sages who discern the truth about both.

O descendant of Bharata, know that it is I who is the Kṣetragnya who resides in the Kṣetras of all beings. The discernment between Kṣetra and Kṣetragnya is considered as true knowledge.

Listen now as I give you the complete knowledge of what the field is, what its nature is, how change takes place within it and from what it is created. I will also speak to you of who the knower of this field of activities is and what the knower's purview is.

This knowledge is what is spoken of by all the sages and documented in all of the Vedas in various ways. This is the knowledge that the Brahma Sutras talk about and the knowledge that the realized beings speak of.

The five great elements, the ego, the intangible intellect, the eleven senses (five for impressions, five for expression and the mind), and the five objects of these senses: liking and aversion, happiness and misery, reverberance, the body, consciousness and the will. All these comprise the Kṣetra and its modifications.

**Narrator:**
The next five Shlokas describe various qualities that Lord Krishna ascribes to true knowledge. He lists out:

**Lord Krishna:**
Humbleness, freedom from hypocrisy, non-violence, forgiveness, simplicity, service of the Guru, cleanliness of the body and mind, steadfastness and self-control.

Dispassion towards the objects of the senses, absence of egotism, keeping in mind the evils of birth, disease, old age and death.

Non-entanglement, absence of clinging to spouse, children, home and so on. Even-mindedness amidst pleasant and unpleasant situations of life.

Constant and exclusive devotion towards Me, an inclination for solitary places and an aversion for mundane society.

Constant immersion in spiritual knowledge and realization of the eternal truth of unity. All these I declare to be knowledge, and what is contrary to it, I call ignorance.

I shall now reveal to you that which ought to be known and by knowing which one attains immortality. It is the beginningless Brahman which lies beyond that which exists and that which doesn't.

It has its manifestations everywhere with many kinds of hands and feet, eyes, heads and faces. Its ears are everywhere and it pervades everything in the universe.

Though the all-pervading unity perceives all sense objects, yet it is devoid of any sensory organs. It is not entangled with anything and yet is the sustainer of it all. Although the Brahman is without attributes, it is the consumer of the three modes of materialistic nature.

It exists outside and inside all living beings, those that are moving and non-moving. It is subtle and hence is incomprehensible at a physical level. It is very far with one kind of an approach but is also very near with another.

It is indivisible yet appears to be distinct for each living being. Know the supreme entity to be the sustainer, annihilator and creator of all beings.

It is the source of light in all luminaries and is entirely beyond the darkness of ignorance. It is knowledge, the object of knowledge and the goal of knowledge. It dwells within the hearts of all living beings.

I have thus revealed to you the nature of the body, the nature of true knowledge and the objective of such knowledge. Only the devotees of Me can understand this in reality and by doing so they attain to My very own state of being.

Know that Prakriti, the material energy of creation, and Purusha, the consciousness that drives it, are both without a beginning. Also know that all attributes and changes to these attributes are born out of Prakriti.

In the matters of the need for activity, the driver of activity and the action itself, it is the material energy which is the cause. And in the matters of experience, like happiness and sorrow, it is the consciousness which is the cause.

The consciousness which is established within the material manifestation consumes the effects and attributes born out of it. Due to its entanglement with these attributes, it gets reborn in various kinds of forms.

That which witnesses everything, allows these experiences to happen, sustains and consumes them, is none other than the supreme divinity itself. It resides within all material bodies but is beyond the realm of the physical.

The one who knows this distinction between the consciousness, materialistic nature and its attributes, such a person who is fully present in each moment, doesn't get reborn again.

Some try to perceive the true self within their own interiority through meditation, and others try to do so through the cultivation of knowledge and analysis, while yet others strive to attain that realization by the path of action.

There are yet others who are unaware of this true nature of the self but they hear from others and begin worshipping this supreme entity. By such devotion towards what they have just heard about, they too shall cross over the ocean of birth and death.

O best of the Bharatas, whatever is mobile or immobile in all of creation, know it to be a combination of Kshetra, the materialistic manifestation, and Kshetragnya, the knower of it.

The one who is equanimous and sees this unchanging supreme divinity which is established in all of this ever-changing creation, such a person is truly perceptive.

A person who looks at everything with equanimity, identifies the supreme Lord in all of creation and causes no harm to any being, such a person attains to the highest of abodes.

The one who understands that all activity is born out of the materialistic nature while the consciousness just stays a witness untouched by this activity, such a person is truly perceptive.

When a person perceives that the same single divinity is manifest as so many different aspects of creation, then one attains to the realization of the true extent of the Brahman.

The true self is imperishable without beginning and devoid of any material qualities, O son of Kunti. Although situated within the body, it neither acts nor is it tainted by material nature.

Just as the space that holds even the subtlest of elements is not smeared by it, similarly, even by pervading the entire existence, the true self is not smeared by it.

Just as one sun illuminates the entire world, so does the consciousness illuminate the entire body, O Arjuna.

Those who perceive with the eyes of knowledge, the difference between the Kshetra and the Kshetragnya, and the process to get liberated from the cycles of materialistic nature, they attain the supreme destination.

**Narrator:**
And thus ends the 13th chapter by the name of Kṣetrakṣetragnya-vibhāgayogaḥ. This is taken from Srimad Bhagavad Gita, a conversation between Lord Krishna and Arjuna on the science of Yoga, which is the knowledge of ultimate reality, called as Brahmavidya.
